# hello-world
Place to practice/test with Git
Github wants me too write about myself but I'm drawing a blank. Not sure what I should type. I don't know why I find that so hard, even in interview questions, I  don't know what to say.
The first thing that comes to mind is always "... I'm a Taurus, I like long walks on the beach..."
